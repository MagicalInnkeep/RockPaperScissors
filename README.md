# RockPaperScissors

## What

Foundational project for **The Odin Project** Javascript course. 

This implementation doesn't follow the assignement exactly.\
I've opted to only quickly glance at the requirements and not to follow along with the guide.\
This mearly to check if my way of thinking is sufficiently similar to the proposed way.\
Except for the fact that I evaluate ints instead of "Rock","Paper" or "Scissor", I believe my solution is identical to the proposed one.

## Goal

Version 1: Create a simple Javascript game within the console.
Version 2: Create a UI for the game
